VendorBait is a small addon I wrote to complement Tuller's "SellFish":http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info7035-SellFish.html addon.  When turning in a quest which gives a "select your reward" section, the items' sell values are pulled from SellFish and the item with the highest value is highlighted.

VendorBait does not provide price data, for that you will need "SellFish":http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info7035-SellFish.html or an addon that implements the "GetSellValue API":http://www.wowwiki.com/API_GetSellValue
