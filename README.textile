VendorBait is a small addon I wrote to complement Tuller's "SellFish":http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info7035-SellFish.html addon.  When turning in a quest which gives a "select your reward" section, the item with the highest value is highlighted.

As of patch 3.2 the WoW API provides vendor prices, so you no longer need an addon like SellFish to provide prices.
